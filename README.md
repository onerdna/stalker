## ‚ùó How to install
- Download and install the APK file from [releases](https://github.com/onerdna/stalker/releases) page
- Install [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/)
- Start Shizuku service if it's not already running. There are great tutorials on the internet of doing so.
- Launch the app, grant Shizuku permissions.
- Proceed to the additional setup step. Before that, ensure that the game is fully closed. Minimize the app (do not fully close it!), open the game and wait until it fully loads. Then, close the game, go back to the app and tap "Reinitialize" button.

### ‚ùó Before using...
- Completely close the game before opening the app.
- If you make any changes, you must tap the 'Save' button for them to take effect.

## ‚ùì FaQ
- **Will there ever be an IOS version?**
  - No.
- **Why does the app use Shizuku?**
  - Shizuku is required to access save files, which aren't normally accessible to regular apps. It's also used to launch the setup service binary.
- **Can you add verified gems, raid consumables or a damage hack?**
  - No.
- **What does the setup service actually do? I'm concerned about running high-privileged compiled binaries.**
  - The setup service‚Äôs only purpose is to tamper with your user ID inside the game‚Äôs process. Once it does that, it automatically closes ‚Äî or after two minutes of inactivity. The user ID is just a random string unique to each device. It doesn‚Äôt contain any personal or device-identifiable information. I won‚Äôt share the exact method used to get the ID, or the source code for the service, because this is the only known working method. If it becomes public, the developers could easily patch it.

## üîß Troubleshooting
- Tapping 'Reinitialize' after the 'Additional setup' step does nothing.
  1. Make sure that you are following the given instructions.
  2. For some devices, changing the 'Logger buffer size' in Developer Options from 256K to 8M might help.
  3. For Huawei and Honor devices, you need to enable logcat in the device settings. Search online for: 'enable logcat honor/huawei'
  4. If this does not help, report a bug [here](https://github.com/onerdna/stalker/issues/new?template=additional-setup-bug-report.md)
